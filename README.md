#**Robot Helper**

By Joel Hafycz and Ryan Melillo


Elevator Pitch:



How to Play:
Use the left and right arrow keys to move back and forth, and the up arrow key to jump (or double jump!). Avoid the workers and the spikes while you navigate the level and complete the puzzles. Pickup and drop boxes with the spacebar, and place them in the top of the correct slots. Use the pads and machines to make, delete, and edit the boxes to help you complete the levels. Goodluck!
